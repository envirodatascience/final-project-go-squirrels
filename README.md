Squirrels are one of the most common mammals in North America, but are rarely the subject of studies. They also are one of the few animals who thrive among humans. Our group is investigating what factors may affect squirrel composition and behavior in Central Park based off of The Squirrel Census conducted in 2018. 
Specifically, we are going to analyze a set of subquestions: 
(1) How many nut-producing trees are in Central Park? Where are they located? Do squirrels strategically cluster around these trees?
(2) Are squirrels behavior altered around nut-producting trees?
(3) Does the weather affect squirrel activity levels?
(4) Is there a correlation between specific types of behavior in squirrels in Central Park and weather?

Data Descriptions:
*   2018 Central Park Squirrel Census - Squirrel Data from [NYC open data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw/about_data). This data set provides the first official count of Central Park's squirrel population. In October 2018, 323 volunteers went out over 11 days to count the number of squirrels in an assigned hectare. "This table contains squirrel data for each of the 3,023 sightings, including location coordinates, age, primary and secondary fur color, elevation, activities, communications, and interactions between squirrels and with humans."

*   2018 Central Park Squirrel Census - Hectare Data from [Data.gov data catalog](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/2018-central-park-squirrel-census-hectare-data). "This table contains environmental data related to each of the 350 “countable” hectares of Central Park. Examples include weather, litter, animals sighted, and human density."

*   2018 Central Park Squirrel Census - Hectare Grid from [NYC open data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/dataset/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Hectare-Grid/qad5-y26n/about_data). "This dataset is the hectare grid that was used to divide Central Park for the 2018 Squirrel Census."
*   Central Park Boundary Polygon created by Zaya using GIS. 
*   Central Park Buildings and Central Park Water Features were filtered by Zaya.
*   Weather Data for October 2018 from NOAA, avaliable online and hosted for our project here: https://github.com/envirodatascience/final-project-go-squirrels/blob/main/Central_Park_Weather.csv
