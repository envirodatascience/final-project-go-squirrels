Squirrels are one of the most common mammals in North America, but are rarely the subject of studies. They also are one of the few animals who thrive among humans. Our group is investigating what factors may affect squirrel composition and behavior in Central Park based off of a squirrel census conducted in 2018. 
Specifically, we are going to analyze a set of subquestions: 
(1) How many nut-producing trees are in Central Park? Where are they located? Do squirrels strategically cluster around these trees?
(2) Are squirrels behavior altered around nut-producting trees?
(3) Does the weather affect squirrel behavior? Or the number of squirrels seen in a day?
(4) Is there a difference in squirrel distribution based on how busy an area of Central Park is?
